## Food Truck Project
### Overview
This program was written as a Week-2 homework assignment for Skill Distillery. Its function is to store a list of food trucks identified by thier unique ID, Name, Cuisine, and Rating. Then, the program will offer options on how the user would like the information to be displayed.

### Topics
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Packages
* toString()
* this.
* arrays
* for/do/while loops
* if/else statements
* switches

### How To Run
1. The user determines the size of the array by entering a whole number.
2. Each truck is named, its cuisine defined, and a rating assigned. The user is given the option to quit out of the identifier before completing the array if they so wish.
3. The menu is printed to the screen. Following the on screen navigation performs the listed function.

### Lessons Learned
This excersise forced me to grapple with the inner workings of object orientation. It also challenged me to dig into the Java libraries to discover functions that I struggled to compile the "hard way". Potentially chief among all these lessons was the understanding if the heap and how information can be pointed to and away from important data points.
